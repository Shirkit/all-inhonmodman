- Changed annoying behavior when Manager starts. It was pop-uping an error message if a mod failed to load before the main window actually load, so the baloon wouldn't be displayed as a program in the task bar, but you had to press OK to continue. Now main window loads before show pop-up messages.

[b]0.7.1 alpha:[/b]
- Mod developers can now use a Insert action after a Delete. Although the developer should use the Replace action in this case, but this shall be allowed from now on.
- '\' inside editfile's path will be replaced with '/' to avoid mistakes. File separators inside ZIP files need to be represented with '/', but since this can be fixed, it will be.
- Added ability to navigate through the mod list in using the keyboard (Arrow keys to go up or down, Enter or Space to enable/disable mod).

[b]0.7.2 alpha:[/b]
- Fixed bug I had generated while searching for strings. Example: 12345678905. If I search for 5, I would stop on the first 5. But on a second search, I was starting the search on the same position again, so it would return the same 5, not the next one.
- Fixed a pop-up message with   wrong reference.
- Rebuilt the project for relaunch. Hope this will fix issues with some users.

[b]0.7.4 alpha:[/b]
- Improved logging methods to handle uncatch exceptions. This will make logging avaluation much easier if unknow exceptions are found.
- Fixed problem with UTF-16. Although no mod developer should use it, since the specification is meant to be UTF-8, the manager can now read UTF-16 without problems.
