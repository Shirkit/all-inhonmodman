All-In HoN ModManager

Java Modification Manager for Heroes of Newerth - offers an easy management for user made modifications.
This application is based on the original ModMan (.exe) created by the user "Notausgang".

Here you have access to the source code of our project.
Currently, this is divided in some parts:
- ModManager
- PropertiesToWiki
- RepoIntegration
- Updater

Each one of those folders contains the source code for it's own part of the project.

If you want to contribute, please, talk to the developers in the SourceForge before you start working.
That way you can get some help, introduction and some tasks that needs to be done.
