- '\' inside editfile's path will be replaced with '/' to avoid mistakes. File separators inside ZIP files need to be represented with '/', but since this can be fixed, it will be.
- Added ability to navigate through the mod list in using the keyboard (Arrow keys to go up or down, Enter or Space to enable/disable mod).

[b]0.7.2 alpha - 16/10/2010:[/b]
- Fixed bug I had generated while searching for strings. Example: 12345678905. If I search for 5, I would stop on the first 5. But on a second search, I was starting the search on the same position again, so it would return the same 5, not the next one.

[b]0.7.3 alpha - 21/10/2010:[/b]

- Improved logging methods to handle uncatch exceptions. This will make logging avaluation much easier if unknow exceptions are found.

- Added status message with current mod enabled and message while applying and updating mods, with 3 dots animation.

- Fixed varius flickering in Progress Bar, in the Main Window and while starting the Manager. (some still continue =\)
- Un-updateable mods can't be updated anymore (thanks to Awan`Afuqya).
- Added option to import from older ModManager.
- Added support for showing Error Messages with Details (for future implementation of Developer Mode).

- Fixed a bug while updating manager on all operational systems. Thanks to lennart_s for the help!

- Only one instance of the manager will be allowed to run at the same time. This will prevent some problems with resources999.s2z being lock by another Manager.

- Fixed bug while copying mods to the mods folder (it was generating a xyz.honmod FOLDER).
- Fixed bug while updating mods with slow connections (30% of the mods fail to connect).
- Fixed bugs while applying mods. Blank editfile Actions like the new Bang! UI Tweak was crashing the manager. Findall with Insert in some specific mods was leading into bad actions, fixed that too (Manager's fault).
- Fixed bug while Drag'n'Drop mods.
- Disabled Details View (until I found out a solution for that, it will remain disabled).
- Fixed un-caught exceptions.

[b]0.9.1 beta - 15/03/2011:[/b]
- Fixed bug with <findup> action.
- Added mod to remind people when a new patch comes out to apply and update their mods again (thanks to Notausgang for the source!).
- Fixed problem while updating the manager (thanks to Tisser! I totally forgot to put " between the arguments, leading to problems if the path had a blank space).
- Changed timeout of the updater from 2500 to 3000 miliseconds.
- Changed the way the Mod Manager uses the OS temporary folder. Now it'll group up the folder in %TEMP%\Hon ModManager\%RANDOM INTEGER%, instead of %TEMP%\%RANDOM INTEGER%, making it easier to delete ModManager temporary files.

[b]0.9.2 beta - 19/03/2011:[/b]
- Fixed bug involving loading user's chosen language.
- Started translations. All job around it is done. People who wants to help translation, just talk to Shirkit.

- Fixed bug while double-cliking not updating the Enable/Disable Mod button.
- Fixed bug with <findall> operation followed by a <delete> action.
- Added comment to resources999.s2z file. Now, if you lost the managerOptions.xml but the resources999.s2z is untouched, you can just import the mods from the file!
- After adding a mod through "Add Mod" button, next time you press it again, it will start from the folder of the file previously selected. If the Manager closes, the folder will be the location of the Manager.jar file.
- Fixed bug after adding mods (through any way) and the current view and the other views didn't update to show the added mods.

[b]0.9.3 beta - 31/03/2011:[/b]
- Fixed bug with Details view. Actually, fixed bug with all views. It was processing all 4 views at the same time, independent if you are using that view or not. Changed this behavior, so improved performance on slow computers.
- Fixed bug with <findall> operation followed by <insert> and <replace> operations. The insert I misschanged the iterator (I did that in all findall actions ¬¬ CTRL+C CTRL+V!) and corrected the difference for the cursor in for the replace action (thanks to Srs Bsns mod, with it I saw those errors).
- Fixed the table not updating after enabling a dependency mod.
- Fixed bug with condition checking. A condition (not 'MiniUI' and not 'Bang! Misclick Master' and not 'BardUI++') was causing the Manager to throw exception, because there was a do-while being called where a simple while should be, calling a null token.
- Added suggestion to update all mods after updating the Heroes of Newerth.
- Tried to fix bug that would clear the current mod enabled list. Now, if applied mod list is empty and this ain't the first time you open the Manager, it will suggest to load from the resources999.s2z file.
- Fixed bug while loading default language to english.
- Updated English language file.
- Added Strings Code Table in the language list for easier translations.
- Re-organizied the project folder and file tree.

- Fixed bug that would allow loading un-finished translations.

[b]0.9.4 beta - 10/04/2011:[/b]
- Fixed bug while auto-updaing. Now using a String Array it prevents error indepedent of OS, blank spcaes or uncommon characters on path. Problem solved now for life!
- Added bar animation while applying mods and exiting the Manager.
- Fixed annoying behavior that changed the LaF without pressing the Apply button.
- Added new optional attribute to <copyfile>. "fromresource" will copy the source file from the resources0.s2z file to target destination. Althougth you can use it without using both "name" and "source" attributes, it doesn't make sense if you use just one of them.
- Fixed another bug when leaving Developer Mode.
- Moved "Manager.lock" file to %TEMPDIR%/Hon ModManager
- Removed fatal log.
- Removed 2 log files. Now there will be only one Log file with unlimited size.

- If deleting a mod fails, now it doesn't vanishs with the mod.
- After adding a mod, stopped behavior of disabling all current enabled mods.

- Loading HonModMan.properties from file now supports UTF-8.
- Added German, Portuguese (Brazillian), Russian and Turkish languages.
- Added a SplashScreen.
- Details View now remembers (again, it was removed) the columns width (not it's positions).
- If a "string" isn't found on the local language file (russian, for example), now it'll look in the english file. This will allow the ability to put new strings without having instant update on all language files.
- Java doesn't write BOM bytes in default and ignore them on reading. Made a little hack to make sure write BOM header in all UTF-8 Files, since HoN seems to need it sometimes (famous Unread Bits error). I hope this is finally fixed.
- Removed Synthetica Look and Feel.

- Updated Turkish language.

- Restored older Driver for parsing XML because the one I used to retrieve LineNumbers didn't worked.
- Added small icons feature.
- DetailsView now uses L10n for header options.
- Note: Changes to strings file have been made
- Details View options "color checkboxes" and "show icons" are now properly saved

- Restored new SAX XML Driver for parsing the mods.
- Fixed problem with position attribute in a find action.
- DetailsView now saves column order.
- Added new method to sort mods. This shall fix some uncommon errors while many mods are active.

- Changed button size on the Preferences Dialog.
- Set the default LaF correctly when the manager runs for the first time.
